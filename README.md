# Sudoku-Solver
Code for a sudoku solver in Python 3.
Has solved easy and medium sudoku (is the plural of sudoku sudokus or sudoku?) however has struggled with hard sudoku (specifically the NY Times March 14 2019 Hard Sudoku)
Need to make sure it can solve all sudoku quickly, then implement a front end so that it's less of a pain to use.
